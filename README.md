# You vs. Python
Solve and rename fast to avoid getting attacked by the Python.

## To start:
- Create a new empty folder for the script.
- Run the youvspython.py

## To play:
#### Start:
- At the start of the game the Python will start a timer, and will give a question.
- 3 things named "=" will appear at the directory.
#### To do:
- You need to rename the = with the answer.
- To know which "=" you need to name out of three you need to get the first digit of the answer.
- The type of "=" you need to rename according to the first digit as follows:
#### Types and First Digit:
| Types | First Digit |
| --- | --- |
| Folder | 0
| .txt | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
| .py | 6, 7, 8, 9
#### End:
- After the time reaches zero the Python will check the renamed answer.
- If the renamed correct answer exists you will be able to escape.
- If not, you will get bitten by the Python.
